## üîß Classes <a name = "classes"></a>

Binary Tree

A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

TreeNode Class

Represents a node in the binary tree.

Methods

- constructor(value): Initializes a new node with the given value.

BinaryTree Class

Represents a binary tree.

Methods

- constructor(): Initializes an empty binary tree.
- insert(value): Inserts a value into the binary tree.
- insertNode(node, newNode): Helper method to insert a node in the correct position.
- search(value): Searches for a value in the binary tree.
- searchNode(node, value): Helper method to search for a value starting from the given node.
- inOrderTraversal(callback): Traverses the tree in order and applies a callback to each node's value.
- inOrder(node, callback): Helper method for in-order traversal.
- preOrderTraversal(callback): Traverses the tree in pre-order and applies a callback to each node's value.
- preOrder(node, callback): Helper method for pre-order traversal.
- postOrderTraversal(callback): Traverses the tree in post-order and applies a callback to each node's value.
- postOrder(node, callback): Helper method for post-order traversal.

isBST Function

Checks if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST).

Parameters

- node: The root node of the binary tree.
- min: Minimum allowed value for the node.
- max: Maximum allowed value for the node.

Returns

- true if the tree is a BST, false otherwise.

Time Complexity

- Insertion, Search: O(log n) on average for balanced trees, O(n) in the worst case for unbalanced trees.
- Traversal: O(n).

Graph

A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices.

Graph Class

Represents an unweighted graph.

Methods

- constructor(): Initializes an empty graph.
- addVertex(vertex): Adds a vertex to the graph.
- addEdge(vertex1, vertex2): Adds an edge between two vertices.
- dfs(start): Performs depth-first search starting from the given vertex.
- bfs(start): Performs breadth-first search starting from the given vertex.

WeightedGraph Class

Represents a weighted graph.

Methods

- constructor(): Initializes an empty weighted graph.
- addVertex(vertex): Adds a vertex to the graph.
- addEdge(vertex1, vertex2, weight): Adds a weighted edge between two vertices.
- dijkstra(start, finish): Finds the shortest path between two vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- bfsShortestPath(start, finish): Finds the shortest path between two vertices using BFS.

Time Complexity

- DFS, BFS: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: O((V + E) log V).

---

Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node, which contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

Node Class

Represents a node in the linked list.

Methods

- constructor(value): Initializes a new node with the given value.

LinkedList Class

Represents a linked list.

Methods

- constructor(): Initializes an empty linked list.
- insert(value): Inserts a value at the end of the linked list.
- delete(value): Deletes the first occurrence of the given value from the linked list.
- search(value): Searches for a value in the linked list.
- hasCycle(): Detects if the linked list has a cycle.
- createCycle(pos): Creates a cycle in the linked list at the specified position.
- printList(): Prints the linked list.

Time Complexity

- Insertion, Deletion, Search: O(n).

---

Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

Queue Class

Represents a basic queue.

Methods

- constructor(): Initializes an empty queue.
- enqueue(element): Adds an element to the end of the queue.
- dequeue(): Removes and returns the first element of the queue.
- peek(): Returns the first element of the queue without removing it.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
- size(): Returns the number of elements in the queue.
- printQueue(): Prints the queue.

PriorityQueue Class

Represents a priority queue where each element has a priority.

Methods

- enqueue(val, priority): Adds an element to the queue with a given priority.
- dequeue(): Removes and returns the element with the highest priority.
- sort(): Sorts the queue based on priority.

Time Complexity

- Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek: O(1) for basic queue. O(log n) for priority queue operations due to sorting.

---

Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

Stack Class

Represents a basic stack.

Methods

- constructor(): Initializes an empty stack.
- push(element): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- peek(): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
- size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- clear(): Clears the stack.
- printStack(): Prints the stack.

MinMaxStack Class

Extends the basic stack to support O(1) retrieval of the minimum and maximum elements.

Methods

- push(element): Adds an element to the stack and updates the min and max stacks.
- pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack and updates the min and max stacks.
- getMin(): Returns the minimum element in the stack.
- getMax(): Returns the maximum element in the stack.
- clear(): Clears the stack and the min and max stacks.

Time Complexity
